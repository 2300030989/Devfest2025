  When dealing with more advanced UI elements there are a lot of things that go wrong. They impact performance, accessibility and have the tendency to create frustrations along the way. 

  By combining modern web capabilities we'll take a peek at the future of styling custom UI by only using HTML and CSS. Strap on your seatbelt, because in this presentation, we'll be diving into the world of popovers, invokers, stylable selects, and accordions. Giving you less frustration, performance boosts and basic accessibility out of the box.

  In this talk, I will be introducing you to the W3C community around Open UI, while also taking a little detour with the Anchoring positioning in CSS for some beautiful UI made easy with web capabilities.
