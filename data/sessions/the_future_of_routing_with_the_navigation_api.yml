  Today, virtually all Single Page Applications (SPAs) use a router. Each frontend framework offers one (or more), with often very similar APIs. Frontend routing is generally considered a solved problem. However, the reality is quite different: frontend routing relies on browser APIs that are frankly outdated.

  In this presentation, we will explore the APIs that have shaped routing as we know it today. Then, we will discover what the future holds with the **Navigation API**, a promising new interface that could very well be a game-changer.
