abstract: In the 1982 TV series "knight rider", the idea of a talking, intelligent car was pure science fiction. Now, more than 40 years later, we have all the tools needed to bring this vision to life - right in the browser, using JavaScript. In this talk, we’ll combine AI techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and function calling with advanced browser APIs like WebBluetooth to create an AI agent with personality, memory, and autonomous decision-making abilities. Leveraging WebAssembly, WebGPU, and other cutting-edge browser technologies, this entire experience happens directly in the browser, running fully offline and privacy preserving by default!
