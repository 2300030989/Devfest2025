abstract: Today, most websites are loading third-party scripts that are not fully under the control of the developer. Statistically, the more third parties you load, the lower your web performance will be. Unhead, a library from the UNJS eco-system has released a new composable `useScript`to improve DX for loading third-party scripts. We'll see what issues you can encounter with third-parties and how to solve it by just using unhead.
