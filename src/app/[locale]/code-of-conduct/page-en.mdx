### Making a personal report

You can make a personal report by contacting a staff member, identified by **"DevFest Safe" or "Shadow Master" t-shirt**.

#### What happens next?

When taking a personal report, our staff will:

1. **Ensure you are safe** and cannot be overheard
2. May involve other event staff to ensure your report is managed properly
3. **Ask you to tell us about what happened** - This can be upsetting, but we'll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support you
4. **You won't be asked to confront anyone** and we won't tell anyone who you are

Our team will be happy to help you:
- Contact hotel/venue security

**We value your attendance.**

### Report via email

If you make a report via email, please include:

- **The title format**: `[DevFest Nantes] COC Violation`
- **Your contact info** (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up)
- **Date and time** of the incident
- **Location** of incident
- **Whether the incident is ongoing**
- **Description** of the incident
- **Identifying information** of the reported person: name, physical appearance, height, clothing, voice accent, identifying badge information such as company name, ribbons, or badge number

### Confidentiality

**All reports will be kept confidential.** 

When we discuss incidents with people who are reported, we will anonymize details as much as we can to protect reporter privacy.

However, some incidents happen in one-on-one interactions, and even if the details are anonymized, the reported person may be able to guess who made the report. 

If you have concerns about retaliation or your personal safety, please note those in your report. **We still encourage you to report**, so that we can support you while keeping our conference attendees safe. 

In some cases, we can compile several anonymized reports into a pattern of behavior, and take action on that pattern.

In some cases we may determine that a public statement will need to be made. If that's the case, **the identities of all victims and reporters will remain confidential** unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.
