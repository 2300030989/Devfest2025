abstract: Is your organization ready to revolutionize your coding experience with generative AI tools, like copilot, ChatGPT, or code whisperer? Do you know how to code safely with generative AI tools increasing your delivery speed without compromising security? In this session, we’ll discuss some of the dangers of generative AI, including hallucinations and security risks. We’ll live code a Spring coffee shop application using copilot, and ChatGPT, and live hack the results, showing how the generated code can be exploited in a running app. We’ll uncover generated SQL injections, Cross site scripting, directory traversal and more. Don't miss this electrifying opportunity to explore the cutting edge of coding technology. Join us and embark on a journey where velocity meets security, and innovation knows no bounds. Secure your spot now and get ready to code like never before! In this session you'll learn how you can leverage the power of AI to increase your velocity while mitigating risks and staying secure.
